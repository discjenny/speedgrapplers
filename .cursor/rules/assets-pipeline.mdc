description: Level JSON, decor manifest, HDRI usage, and validation
---

### Levels and Decor
- Levels are JSON primitives with anchors and spawns; colliders are implicit from primitives.
- Maintain `assets.manifest.json` mapping decor ids to local GLB paths; avoid hardcoded paths in components.

### Loading
- Dynamic-import HDRIs from `@pmndrs/assets`; dynamic-import large models.
- Use `useGLTF.preload` for upcoming levels/screens.

### Validation
- Provide a schema/validator for levels; check tile intersections and anchor spacing in a tool.
