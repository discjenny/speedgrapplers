description: Camera follow, zoom smoothing, and elimination thresholds
---

### Camera
- Follow the front 50% of active players; bias toward leader along X.
- Smooth position with a critically damped spring (~3 Hz) and zoom (~1.5 Hz); keep all active players in frame with ~20% padding.

### Elimination
- Eliminate when a player leaves the safe frame by >12% of viewport for >0.8 s.
- If stalemate >15 s, shrink padding by ~1%/s down to minimum; end when one remains or finish is crossed.
