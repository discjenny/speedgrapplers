description: Drei helpers usage for assets, environment, and UI
---

### Assets and Environment
- Use `useGLTF` with `useGLTF.preload` for known assets/routes; rely on Suspense.
- Load HDRI via dynamic import from `@pmndrs/assets` and `<Environment files={exr} />`.
- Avoid heavy reflective helpers on low-spec hardware; gate with a perf flag.

### UI
- Use `<Text>` (SDF) for labels where possible; reserve `<Html>` for complex DOM HUD only when necessary.
