### Tests
- Join/ack/reconnect/token flows; input rate throttle; snapshot cadence.
- Controller UI: pointer events for stick/buttons; haptic calls mocked.
- R3F: mount minimal scenes to assert materials/geometry and hook behavior.

### Performance Checks (TV)
- Target ≥ 60 FPS on TV; GC pauses < 8 ms under load; cap DPR ≤ 1.5 and drop on sustained spikes.
